<h1>Computers, the Internet, and HTML</h1>

<h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2>

<p>Hypertext Markup Language, or <em>HTML</em>, is the basic language structure that a computer uses
to comunicate with the internet and other computers
in order to display web pages, images, videos, games, <em>anything</em>.
It instructs what and how text is displayed, where pictures and videos live, and so on.
</p>

<h2>The Internet</h2>

<p>When you, say, click on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">link</a>,
the computer sees the link as <em>HTTP</em> (HyperText Transfer Protocol),
which it sends to another computer, known as a  <em>server</em>.
When the server finds the appropriate webpage, image, etc.,
it sends your computer HTML to instruct it on how to display the information.
</p>

<h2>HTML Structure</h2>

<q>Each individual piece within HTML is called an <q>element</q>.
Each element has a tag, which denotes what it is and what it does.
Tags can be used to make the text
<b>bold</b>,
<em>italicized</em>,
<u>underlined</u>,
<s>struckthrough</s>
create <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/doing_business_with_us/publications/~/media/B1162355D3FB4B7CBB41D46F0D666F0F.ashx">links</a>,
and various other things.
An element takes the form: < tag  >content< /tag ></q>.
The <q>/</q> denotes that it is an end-tag -
without it, the tag would run straight to the end.
So, instead of just one word,
you'd make half your sentence bold.
</p>

<h2>You Are Smarter Than the Computer</h2>

<p>The old saying says <q>computers are only as smart
  as the people who program them</q>. This is 100% correct.
  Computers are purely proceedural; they cannot interpret
  what they see as <em>anything</em> other than what it is.
  If you forget a bracket or mistype a URL (web address),
  your page will not look the way you wanted.
</p>

<h2>Two Types of Elements</h2>

<p>HTML elements can be either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
Block elements place the content within an <q>invisible box</q>,
which separates it from the rest of the content on the page.
In general, inline elements are used to modify the look of the text,
while block elements modify how the text appears in the page.
